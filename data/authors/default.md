A software engineer who aims to evolve, innovate, and inspire through technology.

Currently, I am working as a **Software Developer** at **HST Consulting PLC**.

I have previously built the HST Consulting PLC website as part of a team, utilizing technologies such as Next.js and Tailwind CSS. My technical skills include Next.js, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Tailwind CSS, and Figma for design.

I am passionate about prompt engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence, and I am continuously seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise in these areas.

Outside of work, I am actively applying for jobs on Upwork and have attended training sessions from the International Trade Center and Orange Digital Center to enhance my skills in marketable software development and modern software development tools.
